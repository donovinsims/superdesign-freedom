# 🧠 SuperDesign Freedom Edition

This is a fork of the original [SuperDesign](https://github.com/donovinsims/superdesign) project, modified to give you complete freedom and control over your AI design process. No paywalls, no usage limits, and your choice of AI provider.

## 🌟 What is the Freedom Edition?

The Freedom Edition takes the incredible open-source design agent from SuperDesign and removes all restrictions, while adding support for more AI providers. It’s for developers and designers who want to own their tools and data without being locked into a specific API or subscription.

### ✨ Key Features

-   **Choose Your AI Provider**: 
    -   **Google Gemini**: Use Google’s powerful models with a generous free tier (1,500 requests/day).
    -   **Ollama**: Run 100% free, unlimited AI models locally on your own machine.
    -   **Claude API**: The original provider (requires a paid API key).
    -   **OpenAI & OpenRouter**: Still supported for maximum flexibility.
-   **Truly Unlimited**: 
    -   Generate as many designs as you want.
    -   Export to HTML, React, and Vue as many times as you need.
    -   No artificial quotas, limits, or “upgrade to pro” messages.
-   **All Original Features**: Everything that makes SuperDesign great is still here:
    -   🖼️ **Product Mock**: Instantly generate full UI screens from a single prompt.
    -   🧩 **UI Components**: Create reusable components.
    -   📝 **Wireframes**: Explore low-fidelity layouts.
